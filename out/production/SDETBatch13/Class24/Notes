What is PolyMorphism:

PolyMorphism is the ability of a method to behaave differently depending upon the object or parameters that we pass
a method. When we pass different parmeters to a method it behaves differently then it is called STATIC POLYMORPHISM
or COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM or EARLY BINDING. When we achieve the PolyMorphism through method overriding then it
is called DYNAMIC BINDING or

1) cleaner code
2) we never prefer to change the existing code if we want to improve something we always want to create a new
methods and new classes variable/reference
3) we can call multiple methods from many classes with the help of a single variable. Like we can create the array
of objects and with the help of a loop will be able to call all the methods from all the classes.

How can we PolyMorphism:
1) create a parent child relationship
2) override the methods in the child classes
3) create the array of all the child class objects and with the help of loops you can call all the methods from all
the child classes.

Rules:
1) all the rules that apply for overriding also apply for the PolyMorphism.
2) we can store the object of a child class inside a reference variable of type parent class but, we can't do the
reverse.
3) we can also create arrays of type parent and they can hold the objects of child classes.

What is Abstraction:

Abstraction is providing only the necessary details and hiding all the implementation details

Why should we learn Abstraction:
1) it reduces the complexity by separating the idea from implementation
2) it helps use enforce rules and covey our requirements

How can we use Abstraction:
1) create classes with abstract keyword
2) use the abstract keyword with
