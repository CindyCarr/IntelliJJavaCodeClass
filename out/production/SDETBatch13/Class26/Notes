What is an interface:
interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class are public static final(constants)
and all the methods by default are also public

Why we should learn about the interfaces:
We can implement abdstraction using interfaces
When classes are logically connected to each other and we want to have instance fields and implemented
mehtods as well while doing abstraction then we should go with abstract class

How can I use an interface:
We use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract methods

Rules:

1) All the fields inside an interface are public static final
2) No instance fields means no constructor is required
3) No instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract
4) When we implement the methods from the interface we use implements keyword
5) Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in Java
6) An interface can extend another interface
7) Variables in interfaces can't be private protected

What is Encapsulation in Java:
Encapsulations is the 4th pillar of OOPs. It's a mechanism that provides us with security. If we use encapsulation
we can have more security

How to use Encapsulation:
1) Make your variables as private
2) Create setter and getter methods to read and write these fields
