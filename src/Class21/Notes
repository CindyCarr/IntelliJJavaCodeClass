What is super keyword:
Super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class object.

Why should we learn super keyword.
1) if we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we can use the super
keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because by default java prefers the vairables of
child class. We can also call the super class constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super ();

How to use super keyword:
1) we can use super method name or field name to call the method or to access the field of super class
2) ust the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.

Rules:
1) we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method with the help of super
keyword.
2) we can only use super () inside a constructor.
3) if we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor inside
the child classes as well.
4) if we have multiple constructors inside the parent as soon as one is matched we are good to go. We
don't need to match each and every constructor from the parent class.
5) super () should be the 1st line inside a constructor

What is MethodOverloading:

When same name method exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different type of
parameters or different sequence of parameters it's called methodOverloading.

Why should we use MethodOverloading:
1) Makes your code more readable
2) Makes the life of the end users easy. They don't have to memorize many methods names.

How to use MethodOverloading.
We can have same name methods but we have to follow the below rules.
1) by passing different number of parameters
2) we can change the datatype of parameters
3) we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters
